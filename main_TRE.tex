We construct a novel unified panel dataset that records entry, exit, and mergers in the shipping industry between 1966 and 2022. Using the data, we construct a structural matching model \citep{fox2018estimating} to describe historical transition of the importance of tonnage capacity on merger decision. We find that XXX.

\section{Introduction}


\section{Industry Background}
We describe industry background between 1966 and 2022 in chronological order by focusing on firms' entry, exit, and mergers. We classify the periods into five regimes, 1966-1979, 1980-1990, 1991-1999, 2000-2008, and 2009-2022. Each regime corresponds with the institutional background and data source.

\cite{matsuda2022unified}

In the period between 1966 and 1983, two mergers occurred in 1970 (Moore-McCormack Lines Inc merged by United States Lines) and 1972 (Johnson Line merged by NA).

In the period between 1984 and 1990, two mergers occurred in 1986, three mergers occurred in 1988, and two mergers occurred in 1990.

\section{Data}

We construct the data from combining the three data sources. 
The first data source is \textit{the Containerization International Yearbook} (CIY), which provides ship-level information between 1966 and 1990.
The second data source is IHS Markit data, which provides ship-level information between 1991 and 2005.
The third data source is \textit{Handbook of Ocean Commerce}(henceforth, HB), which provides ship-level information between 2006 and 2022.

We define the entry of the firm as the existence of its owned container ships in the industry. 
Also, we define the exit of the firm as the liquidation or bankrupt of the firms or being merged by the other firm.

  Note: The firms which are not operated in the merged year are treated as the firms have the constant capacity level from the last active year in the merged year. For example, Johnson Line was active in 1969-1972 but was merged in 1991.

\section{Empirical analysis}\label{sec:empirical_analysis}

Our objective is to quantify the assortativeness of observed characteristics and merger costs for each regime and compare the levels across regimes. We employ a matching maximum estimator developed by \cite{fox2018estimating}, which is one of the most well-known methods for measuring matching assortativeness.

For exposition, we model mergers in each regime as a two-sided one-to-one transferable matching game in a single market. Let $\mathcal{N}_b$ and $\mathcal{N}_s$ be the sets of potential finite buyers and sellers respectively. Let $b=1,\cdots,|\mathcal{N}_b|$ be buyer firms and let $s=1,\cdots,|\mathcal{N}_s|$ be seller firms where $|\cdot|$ is cardinality. Let $\mathcal{N}_{b}^{m}$ denote the set of ex-post matched buyers and $\mathcal{N}_{b}^{u}$ denote that of ex-post unmatched buyers such that $\mathcal{N}_b= \mathcal{N}_{b}^{m}\cup\mathcal{N}_{b}^{u}$ and $\mathcal{N}_{b}^{m}\cap\mathcal{N}_{b}^{u}=\emptyset$. For the seller side, define $\mathcal{N}_{s}^{u}$ and $\mathcal{N}_{s}^{m}$ as the set of ex-post matched and unmatched sellers such that $\mathcal{N}_s= \mathcal{N}_{s}^{m}\cup\mathcal{N}_{s}^{u}$ and $\mathcal{N}_{s}^{m}\cap\mathcal{N}_{s}^{u}=\emptyset$. Let $\mathcal{M}^m$ be the sets of all ex-post matched pairs $(b,s)\in\mathcal{N}_{b}^{m}\times \mathcal{N}_{s}^{m}$. Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the set of all ex-post matched pairs $(b,s)\in\mathcal{M}^{m}$ and unmatched pairs $(\tilde{b},\emptyset)$ and $(\emptyset,\tilde{s})$ for all $\tilde{b}\in \mathcal{N}_b^u$ and $\tilde{s}\in \mathcal{N}_s^u$ where $\emptyset$ means a null agent generating unmatched payoff. 

Each firm can match at most one agent on the other side, so  $|\mathcal{N}_b^{m}|=|\mathcal{N}_s^{m}|$. The matching joint production function is defined as $f(b,s)=V_b(b,s)+V_s(b,s)$ where $V_b:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $V_s:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. The net matching values for buyer $b$ and seller $s$ are defined as $V_b(b,s)=f(b,s)-p_{b,s}$ and $V_s(b,s)+p_{b,s}$, where $p_{b,s}\in \mathbb{R}_{+}$ is the equilibrium merger price paid to seller firm $s$ by buyer firm $b$ and $p_{b\emptyset}=p_{\emptyset s}=0$. For scale normalization, we assume $V_b(b,\emptyset)=0$ and $V_s(\emptyset,s)=0$ for all $b\in \mathcal{N}_b$ and $s\in \mathcal{N}_s$. Each buyer maximizes $V_b(b,s)$ across seller firms, whereas each seller maximizes $V_s(b,s)$ across buyer firms. 

The stability conditions for buyer firm $b \in \mathcal{N}_b$ and seller firm $s \in \mathcal{N}_s$ are as follows:
\begin{align}
    V_b(b,s) &\ge V_b(b,s') \quad \forall s' \in \mathcal{N}_s \cup \emptyset,s'\neq s,\label{eq:stability_ineq}\\
    V_s(b,s) &\ge V_s(b',s) \quad \forall b' \in \mathcal{N}_b\cup \emptyset,b'\neq b.\nonumber
\end{align}

Based on Equation \eqref{eq:stability_ineq} and equilibrium price conditions $p_{b',s}\le p_{b,s}$ and $p_{b,s'}\le p_{b',s'}$ in \cite{akkus2015ms}, we construct the inequalities for matches $(b,s)\in \mathcal{M}$ and $(b',s')\in \mathcal{M}, (b',s')\neq(b,s)$ as follows:
\begin{align}
    f(b,s)-f(b,s')&\ge p_{b,s}-p_{b,s'}\ge p_{b,s}-p_{b',s'},\label{eq:pairwise_stable_ineq}\\
    f(b',s')-f(b',s)&\ge p_{b',s'}-p_{b',s}\ge p_{b',s'}-p_{b,s},\nonumber\\
    V_s(b,s)-V_s(b',s)&\ge 0,\nonumber\\
    V_{s'}(b',s')-V_s(b,s')&\ge 0,\nonumber
\end{align}
where $p_{b',s}$ and $p_{b,s'}$ are unrealized equilibrium merger prices that cannot be observed in the data. The last two inequalities cannot be derived from the data because the researchers cannot observe how the total matching value $f(b,s)$ is shared between buyer $b$ and seller $s$.

\cite{fox2018estimating} proposes a maximum score
estimator using the above inequalities. The maximum score estimator is consistent if the model satisfies a rank order property, i.e., the probability of observing matched pairs is larger than the probability of observing swapped matched pairs. We specify $f(b,s)$ as a parametric form $f(b,s|X,\beta)$ where $X$ is a vector of observed characteristics of all buyers and sellers and $\beta$ is a vector of parameters. As observed characteristics $X$, we use the age and total tonnage of each firm and the geological location of the flag country at merger timing.


Given $X$, one can estimate $\beta$ by maximizing the following objective function:
\begin{align}
    Q(\beta)=\sum_{(b,s)\in \mathcal{M}} \sum_{(b',s')\in \mathcal{M},(b',s')\neq (b,s)} \mathbbm{1}[f(b,s|X,\beta)+ f(b',s'|X,\beta)\ge f(b,s'|X,\beta)+f(b',s|X,\beta)]\label{eq:score_function}
\end{align}
where $\mathbbm{1}[\cdot]$ is an indicator function.
